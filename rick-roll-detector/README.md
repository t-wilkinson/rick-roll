# rick-roll-detector

A convoluted yet necessary solution to the Rickroll epidemic.

## Features

- Enter in a URL to see if it has any refereces to rick Rick Astley or "Never Gonna Give You Up".
- There is a 30% chance that checking a URL will Rick Roll you.
- An in-memory database which caches whether URLs or dirty or clean.

## Why?

- So I could get some intuition for system design topics in a contrived situation.
- I wanted to write a database from scratch in C.
- It was fun.
